##### Final Project - Movie Ratings #####
#########################################

* Important: This program is designed to be run on Windows.

This program runs on the dataset downloaded from 
http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
Please refer to README_DATASET for detailed information

In this project, we created excel spreadsheets using u.data and u.user from 
which we then generated a data.mat file to simplified the work that needs
to be done with data processing in MATLAB.

We used the opensource libsvm over MATLAB's built-in library because we have
found that libsvm has a good performance and we would like to learn how to
work with a third-party library. 
As a result, please be advised, this program only runs on Microsoft Windows. 
It will not work on MATLAB on other platforms.

In our original "movie" structure, each movie.data contains the information
of each user who has rated this movie already as well as her/his ratings
on this movie. 

Both regression and classification training and testing were performed.
However, this should be a regression problem. We performed classification
to make comparisons and see how good our models project.

After running the main driver program, the struct will have additional
fields storing the training and testing results for both regression
and classification. 

The function that does regression/classification training and testing is the
libsvm_regression.m/libsvm_classify.m file. 

The cgtest.m file is used to compute the optimal c and g values for each model.

There are 4 files used to make libsvm work on Windows:
    1. The buffer file 'allbut.pl'
    2. The script file 'mku.sh'
    3. 'svmtrain.mexw64'
    4. 'svmpredict.mexw64'
